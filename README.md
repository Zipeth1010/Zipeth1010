- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zipeth1010
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack software development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning both front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript + React) and back-end (Python + Django, SQL) at the minute 
- but will later look to specialize in back-end down the line.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different back-end projects to diversify my portfolio and hopefully land me my first entry level job. 
- 📫 How to reach me; email: markchristensen1010@gmail.com.
